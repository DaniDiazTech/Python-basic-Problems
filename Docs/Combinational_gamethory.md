# Combinatorial Games

A combinatorial game are two players games that play with perfect information, and no lucky moves.

## Perfect Information:

In game theory, a sequential game has perfect information if each player, when making any decision, 
is perfectly informed of all the events that have previously occurred, 
including the "initialization event" of the game 
(e.g. the starting hands of each player in a card game)

## Possible final States:

There are three possible final states of the game `Win, Lose and Tie`

These states are determinate by a set of positions, that include the Initial Position and
the move of the player whose turn is to move.

 The game is based on moves from one position to another, with the players usually alternating moves, until a terminal position is reached. A terminal position is one from which no moves are possible. Then one of the players is declared the winner and the other the loser. Or there is a tie (Depending on the rules of the combinatorial game, the game could end up in a tie.

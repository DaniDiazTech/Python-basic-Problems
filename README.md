# Python-basic-Problems

These are my Python 3 basic problems. They are a compilation of python exercises
from different sources.

One of that sources is the Book Python for everyone. You can find the exercises in 
**Python-4-everyone folder**

I tried to implement a good coding style, and in some cases OPP programming.

I'm also trying to make a Documentation in base of Python for everyone, so Probably I'll 
make a repo for the book only.
